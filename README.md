## Welcome dear developer! 👋

This repository contains **examples**, **tutorials**, and **applications** built with Liquid AI open-weight models (LFM) and the open-source LEAP SDK.

Whether you're looking to customize models, deploy to laptops, edge devices, or build complete applications, you'll find resources here to get started.

## What are you looking for? 🔍

- [Examples of local AI applications 🤖](#examples-of-local-ai-applications) that showcase the power of our LFM model family.
- [Fine tuning notebooks and examples 🎯](./finetuning/README.md) to increase the performance of LFM2 models for your specific use case.
- [Deployment to iOS and Android devices 📱](#deployment-to-ios-and-android-devices) with the LEAP SDK

- [End-to-end tutorials 📚](#end-2-end-tutorials) that cover the whole path from data collection, evaluation, fine-tuning and deployment.

- [Examples built by our growing community 🌟](#examples-built-by-our-community) that showcase what is possible with Liquid AI models.

- [60-minute technical deep dives on all-things-efficient-AI](#recorded-sessions-60-minute-technical-deep-dives-on-all-things-efficient-ai) every month in the [Liquid Discord community](https://discord.com/invite/liquid-ai).

## Examples of local AI applications

| Name | What's that? |
|-------|-----------|
| 🧾 [**invoice-parser**](./examples/invoice-parser/README.md) | A Python CLI that extracts structured data from invoice pdfiles using LFM2-VL-3B |
| 🎙️ [**audio-transcription-cli**](./examples/audio-transcription-cli/) | A Python CLI for real-time audio-to-text transcription using LFM2-Audio-1.5B with llama.cpp |
| ✈️ [**flight-search-assistant**](./examples/flight-search-assistant/README.md) | A Python CLI that helps you find and book plane tickets using LFM2.5-1.2B-Thinking with tool calling |
| 🚗 [**audio-car-cockpit**](./examples/audio-car-cockpit/README.md) | A voice-controlled car cockpit demo combining LFM2.5-Audio-1.5B (TTS/STT) with LFM2-1.2B-Tool for real-time local inference |
| 🔊 [**audio-webgpu-demo**](./examples/audio-webgpu-demo/README.md) | Run LFM2.5-Audio-1.5B entirely in your browser with WebGPU for speech recognition, text-to-speech, and interleaved audio/text conversation |
| 📹 [**vl-webgpu-demo**](./examples/vl-webgpu-demo/README.md) | Real-time video captioning with LFM2.5-VL-1.6B running in-browser using WebGPU |


## Deployment to iOS and Android devices

The [LEAP Edge SDK](https://leap.liquid.ai/docs/edge-sdk/overview) is our native framework for running LFM2 models on mobile devices.

Written for Android (Kotlin) and iOS (Swift), the goal of the Edge SDK is to make Small Language Model deployment as easy as calling a cloud LLM API endpoint, for any app developer.

### Android

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [LeapChat](https://github.com/Liquid4All/LeapSDK-Examples/tree/main/Android/LeapChat) | A comprehensive chat application with real-time token streaming, persistent message history, and modern chat UI featuring message bubbles and typing indicators |
| [SloganApp](./examples/leap-slogan-example-ios/README.md) | Single turn generation for marketing. The UI is implemented with Android Views. |
| [ShareAI](https://github.com/Liquid4All/LeapSDK-Examples/tree/main/Android/ShareAI) | Website summary generator |
| [Recipe Generator](https://github.com/Liquid4All/LeapSDK-Examples/tree/main/Android/RecipeGenerator) | Structured output generation with the LEAP SDK |
| [Visual Language Model example](https://github.com/Liquid4All/LeapSDK-Examples/tree/main/Android/VLMExample) | Visual Language Model example |

### iOS

| Example | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| [LeapChat](https://github.com/Liquid4All/LeapSDK-Examples/tree/main/iOS/LeapChatExample) | A comprehensive chat application demonstrating advanced LeapSDK features including real-time streaming, conversation management, and modern UI components. |
| [LeapSloganExample](https://github.com/Liquid4All/LeapSDK-Examples/tree/main/iOS/LeapChatExample) | A simple SwiftUI app demonstrating basic LeapSDK integration for text generation. |
| [Recipe Generator](https://github.com/Liquid4All/LeapSDK-Examples/tree/main/iOS/RecipeGenerator) | Structured output generation |
| [Audio demo](https://github.com/Liquid4All/LeapSDK-Examples/tree/main/iOS/LeapAudioDemo) | A SwiftUI app demonstrating audio input and output with the LeapSDK for on-device AI inference. |
